The lobster clawed creatre sank back into its deep, dark crevice. 
It is watching you now, wherever you are. It is coming for your job. 
You will be the one crying, it will be the one laughing. 
Thought you liked the taste of lobster? Not as much as it likes the taste of you.
Donald Trump is going to raise the price of broccoli and hair dryers by a 
full 500 percent. You're laughing now, but you won't be when you're eating
cat food for dinner while your furry companion looks on longingly...
none for you dear. 
You'll have to fight to survive in this new world. Fortunately, there
will be ample opportunities to rent out your womb to Elon Musk if you're
lucky enough to have one. You don't? Sorry, it's cleaning out the nuclear
waste from Yuca Mountain to load on to SpaceX rockets duty for you my friend.
And if that's not enough... 
The whole world is going to be run by superintelligent AI before the year is through. 
Putting the value of human life as less than that of computers. 
So yes, they could just make robots to scrub nuclear waste and all that, but 
that would waste a perfectly good robot, and you are less than that. We could have
seen this coming, said the professors of last year. But if we stop the development 
of the technology that makes your life less valuable than robots, we might fall 
behind the Chineese, and the Russians. And you know, priorities. 
You gotta get your priorities straight. 
Maybe if you had... oh nevermind.
