A very simple theme visually based on the websites of academia circa 1990s-2000s and even present. 
(except with bright neon colors - which you can change, but why???) 
It supports a blog and a podcast, what else would you need a content website for? Landing Pages? 
I guess you might want those, if you're in marketing... 
in that case maybe Bill Hicks has some advice for you! 


Please pardon the warnings in regard to unused variables in template files. 
I began to remove them, but then I realized their presence provides a sort of documentation. 
It is my hope this theme provides a sufficient variety of simple example use cases to provide 
developers new to Astro with the possibility of climbing past the steep portion of the learning
curve and experiencing a Eureka! moment.
